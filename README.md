## Sorting algorithms presentation

The goal of this project was to play around with TypeScript and recall how we used to create apps without any frameworks. Also, I tried a slightly different way to create components.

It was side-project **for a fun**, do not take it as a "production-ready" example :).

##### Some TO-DOs:
* fix TS linter issues
* add more sorts (selection/shell/merge/tree/?)

##### How to run project
```
npm install
npm start
```
